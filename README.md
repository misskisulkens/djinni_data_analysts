## Analyzing Djinni (Ukrainian hiring service) - Data Analyst Category Only
### !!! Ukrainian Language Only in the Presentation !!!

Hi all, since the situation on the market is rather bad at the moment, I've decided to analyze the data about other candidates (analysts) that are searching for jobs using Djinni.

First, I scrape the data about those. In Python, I'm using the following libraries:
* **requests**;
* **bs4**;
* and **pandas**.

Then, I visualize the data in Tableau Public.

Last step - summarizing it all in a presentation.

It's only available in Ukrainian.

Otherwise, the details can be found in the corresponding files.
